Optimized Ensemble Learning for Chronic Kidney Disease Prognostication: A Stratified Cross-Validation Approach

The models implemented include Support Vector Machines (SVM), LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest, and a Stacking ensemble integrating LightGBM, SVM, and Random Forest. The framework addresses challenges in handling categorical data with Label Encoding, imputation of missing values, and feature scaling for models sensitive to data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the Stacking ensemble achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 99.5%, outperforming individ- ual models, with CatBoost and Random Forest also exhibiting strong predictive power.
